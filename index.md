## A **Free Software Business** is where you combine respect for your users' freedom with your choice of building a business.

## *There is no conflict between the freedom you provide (as a part of your business dealings and software + hardware offerings) and your ability to build a sustainable business based on these offerings.*

*This website provides a starting point and growing resource on what a 
Free Software Business (FSB) is and how to get started with it. It also 
aims to address common questions regarding how Free Software and 
Business can be combined and dispels some of myths surrounding these 
concepts. However, it is assumed that you are aware of what Free 
Software is about and why its important.*

----------

### What is a Free Software Business?

A Free Software Business (FSB) is a business that respects its users' 
freedom. The [freedoms that users deserve](/free-software/) are unalienable. A FSB does not 
compromise on these freedoms when it chooses to do business with its 
users. A FSB is an ethical business that uses software freedom to 
empower its users, instead.

There is a common myth that it is not possible to build a business if 
you provide these freedoms to your users and customers. Over the past 
few decades, there have been examples of hundreds of such businesses 
which have flourished without compromising on their users' right to have 
software freedom.

The reasons your customers will engage with you is that you provide a 
value to them - irrespective of the fact that the software (or hardware) 
that is a component of this transaction is FREE.

What makes a Free Software Business different is that it chooses to put 
its users' rights first. It build a business *because* of Free Software, 
not in spite of it.

### What *can* a Free Software Business do?

A Free Software Business can do anything that a business is permitted to 
do in your community. You can develop software (and hardware), provide 
services, sell support, offer hosting and so much more.

Software Freedom is not a constraint - its a *power*. You can do anything 
that you want to do in your business. If you believe in Free Software, 
you will just choose to do it without restricting the freedom of your 
users and customers (and, even, other businesses) to do the same.

No one can impose how you should run your business, what you should do 
in it or how you should do it. But if you choose to qualify yourself as 
a Free Software Business, then your business dealings and practices 
are a reflection of that.

### Can I build *Open Source Software*?

More often than not, the term "Open Source Software" doesn't really mean 
anything. It has been used to describe a variety of terms under which 
software is distributed. If what you mean by "Open Source Software" is 
exactly what is spelt out in the "Open Source Definition", then sure - 
please go ahead and build "open source software".

However, if by using the term "open source software" to refer to one of 
the hundred-odd unfair approximations of that definition, then we are not 
even sure if we are talking about the same thing.

----------

### What are the other *requirements* of a Free Software Business?

There are no *requirements*. Nothing listed here is a requirement. All 
of this is, at best, an advice and a recommendation. Nothing more. No 
one can really *require* anything from you - that would be highly unfair 
and disrespectful.

However, can you consider if you believe in free software enough to 
choose it as a basis for building your business? Can you translate the 
Free Software philosphy into a set of *business practices* that reflect 
your beliefs?  Do you want to help your users, customers and members of 
your (business or technical or social) community understand and 
appreciate the value of choosing Free Software? It is important to think 
about such questions.

Meanwhile, here are some recommendations for you to consider:

  * **Privacy-first Data Collection and Storage** - Do you collect data 
    from your users or customers? Do your customers entrust you with 
    hosting or storing their data? What can you do to repect the privacy 
    of their data? What sort of protection and committment can you offer 
    to enable them to protect their privacy?

    Why does protecting our privacy have to be an after-thought and 
    band-aid? When all of us care about privacy in similar ways, why 
    can't we build solutions that reflect this value system outright?

  * **File Formats and DRM** - What media formats do you use for any content 
    that you provide? Are any of these formats proprietary? Are you the 
    only developer who can operate on these file formats? Do you encrypt 
    the content using DRM technology? Is it possible for you choose free 
    file formats for your data? 
    
    This applies to eBooks, music, images, vector drawings, bitmaps, 
    videos, audio files and so on.

  * **Vendor Lock-in** - Do you make it simple for your customers to 
    move to other service providers or software? Do you erect barriers 
    to ensure that customers find it difficult or inconvenient to move 
    away from your business? Can you build your offerings in a manner 
    that allow interoperability with others?
